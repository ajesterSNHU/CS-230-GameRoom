# CS-230-GameRoom
## Summary
The Gaming Room client requested a muli-platform game called Draw It or Lose It, where teams complete to guess a revealing image. The client's requirements made sense and provided enough room for development decison making. 
## What Went Well
The design document came together quite well. The final product may need a little work, but seems polished enough to submit to a client. I truly believe in my recommendations.
## Process
This was a iterative process. The document wasn't completed over night and I think that adds to the value. The final document is a product of 8 weeks of research. 
## Approach
My approach to designing software is to always consider the needs tof the client first. I believe in a modern environment, agile software development is (in most cases) best suited. CLients are able to interact more with the developers that create their code and relay product requirement changes to hopeully build a better product by the end of the initial development cycle. 
## Revisions
If I were to go back an revise my design document, I would mention cloud computing as a viable option, but also list pricing information for licensing and scaling.
